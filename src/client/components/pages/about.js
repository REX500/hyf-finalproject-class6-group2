          <h2 className='home-title'>What is HackYourFuture?</h2>
          HackYourFuture is a non-profit that aims to train refugees and asylum
          seekers to become web-developers and empower them by opening the doors
          to a very in-demand job market. In our 6-month program we train
          students with and without a coding background in modern JavaScript
          software development. Our aim is to have our students land their first
          software development job after finishing our course and we do
          everything we can to prepare them as well as possible. With our team
          of experienced senior developers we have created a program around the
          special needs of refugees. Our teachers are all volunteers and
          extremely passionate about coding. We believe talented refugees are a
          great opportunity for society and we are here to give them a helping
          hand to make use of their potential.

          <h2 className='home-title'>How did it start?</h2>
          Reaching its peak in 2015, many European countries saw the arrival of
          a large number of refugees, many among them with high levels of
          education. However, the past teaches us that talented newcomers have
          trouble finding work in their new countries of residence. At the same
          time we observed a very large demand for web-developers on the job
          market. A lot of companies struggle to grow at the rate that they want
          because they lack qualified developers. The modern day developer
          doesn’t need to be the next Mark Zuckerberg either, programming has
          also become a sort of new blue-collar job, with ample opportunities in
          an ever-expanding industry. Here we see an enormous opportunity for a
          win-win situation. By training refugees in web-development we increase
          their chances of employment significantly and at the same time
          increase the amount of developers on the job market and further
          integration.

          <h2 className='home-title'>Core values</h2>
          There is a lot of unfulfilled potential within various disadvantaged
          groups of people. A lot of talent in these groups is being wasted,
          simply because of a lack of opportunity. We believe coding can help
          people in disadvantaged situations live up to their potential, get
          back control of their own lives and be an important change to their
          environment.

            Fundamentals of the HackYourFuture organisation
          </h2>
          HackYourFuture is not about one or a handful of people, but about a
          community of developers who take the responsibility to share their
          knowledge and passion to people who need it the most. There’s no room
          for ego. We teach because we love programming, and we teach because we
          care about others. We teach with volunteers who are professional
          developers themselves. We want our students to learn from the best. We
          teach skills that are 100% relevant for the local job market. Our goal
          is getting people to work, this only works if people learn skills that
          are in demand. We don’t charge our students money, and try to remove
          most barriers to studying with us. Our target audience are talented
          people who have significantly less opportunities to succeed in a
          professional setting than the majority of society. We expect our
          students to put in as much time as they can. Without real commitment,
          you cannot start a career in programming, and therefore you can’t
          study at HackYourFuture.

          Write us a message Developer? Become a mentor - write us a message
          first though, so we can figure out what would make most sense for you
          to do Not a developer? We can always use extra hands on deck - let us
          know how much time you would like to dedicate to volunteering and what
          you are good at. We can use help with Social Media, copywriting,
          photography, CV help, interview coaching, and tons of other small
          things. - We just need to figure out first where you would most like
          to get active.
